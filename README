# Workflow

Days are encoded by %y%d, 2015-12-18 becomes 1518. Start a new day by doing

    just init-day 1518

This creates skeleton files src/aoc/a1518.clj and src/aoc/a1518-2.clj for the
first and second parts of the exercise.

Save the text file input in `resources/1518.txt`

The first file has functions `read` and `eval`, for parsing the text input
downloaded from adventofcode.com and for doing the actual exercise with
whatever you return from `eval`. Since both parts use the same input, the
second part only defines `eval`. Replace the dummy implementations with your
solution to the exercise.

If you think you can be faster by reformatting the input manually than by
writing a parser, convert the input into a Clojure expression and save it in
`resources/1518.edn`. The test runner will look for edn files and will not try
to run `read` if it finds one.

Write the examples and results from adventofcode.com in
`resoources/1518.test`, using lines with only % to separate inputs and outputs
(Unix fortune format):

    first input text
    %
    first output
    %
    second input text
    %
    second output

Run

    just run-test 1518

to test your code against the tests. When the tests pass, run

    just run 1518

to get your result.
