# Workflow

Days are encoded by %y%d, 2015-12-18 becomes 1518. Start a new day by doing

    just init-day 1518

This creates skeleton file src/aoc/a1518.clj for the exercise.

Save the text file input in `resources/1518.txt`

The first file has functions `read` and `eval`, for parsing the text input
downloaded from adventofcode.com and for doing the actual exercise with
whatever you return from `eval`. Since both parts use the same input, the
second part only defines `eval`. Replace the dummy implementations with your
solution to the exercise.

Write the examples and results from adventofcode.com in
`resources/1518-1.test` and `resources/1518-2.test` for the first and second
parts of the task, using lines with only % to separate inputs and outputs
(Unix fortune format):

    first input text
    might have multiple lines
    %
    first output
    %
    second input text
    %
    second output

If all your inputs and outputs are single lines, you can leave out the %
separators. The runner will treat each line as their own element in a file
with no segments separated by %s:

    input1
    output1
    input2
    output2

Run

    just run-test 1518-1

to test your code against the tests. When the tests pass, run

    just run 1518-1

to get your result.
